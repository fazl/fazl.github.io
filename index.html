Hello World

To get my teeth into HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I'm a serverside guy normally..) I thought I'd see if it was easy to build a tictactoe game in a single HTML file.

So here are: 

<ul>
  <li> the <a href="tictactoe/basic-tictactoe.html">basic 3 x 3 Tic Tac Toe</a>, and </li>
  <li> the <a href="tictactoe/resizable-tictactoe.html">resizable n x n Tic Tac Toe</a>, and </li>
</ul>

Enjoy!
